# Pradarsh — Presentation Content

## Slide 1: Title
**Pradarsh**
*The launchpad for developer projects*
Showcase. Discover. Get Inspired.

---

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
- Developers build amazing projects but lack a dedicated platform to showcase them
- GitHub is for code, LinkedIn is for jobs — neither is designed for project discovery
- No easy way for the community to find, filter, and get inspired by real developer work

---

## Slide 3: Solution
**Pradarsh** is a developer-first project showcase platform where:
- Developers publish their projects with rich details (demo, tech stack, screenshots)
- Anyone can explore and discover projects by category, technology, or developer
- The community grows through authentic showcasing, not self-promotion

## Slide 4: Key Features
1. **Project Showcase** — title, description, thumbnail, screenshots, GitHub + demo links
2. **Smart Search & Filter** — search by project name OR developer name, filter by category + technology
3. **Developer Profiles** — public portfolio page for every developer
4. **Authentication** — Email/Password + Google + GitHub OAuth
5. **Live Stats** — real-time platform statistics (projects, developers, categories)
6. **Dashboard** — manage your own projects with full CRUD
